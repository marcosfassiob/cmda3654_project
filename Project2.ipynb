    "Major League Baseball is split up into two leagues: National League and American League. Each league is split up into 3 divisions: East, Central, and West. And each division has 5 teams in it making a total of 30 teams. Each team plays the four other teams in their division 19 times, and the 10 other teams in their league but not in their division either 6 or 7 times. This totals to a 162 game season for every team. The playoffs have changed throughout the years, but this year a total of 12 teams make the playoffs, 6 from both leagues. To win your division you need to have the best record out of the five teams, and the winners of each of the 6 division make the playoffs. In addition, out of all the teams that didn't win their division, the 3 teams with the best records in both leagues make the playoffs. In the playoffs, the two teams that win their league make it to the World Series. The 1 and 2 seed from both leagues get a by and automatically make it to the quarter finals, so those teams have an advantage."
